Much like Hellgondo, the continent’s smaller size also makes it roughly an equivalent to one of Sentora's regions. Ilias Village lies to the south, the capital city Iliasburg is located within the center, the Irina Mountains due west, Happiness Village to the east, Enrika within the forests of the southwest, Iliasport to the northwest, and finally the Treasure Cave to the north. The Ilias continent is where faith in the Goddess Ilias is strongest. But although its people have a reputation for prejudice against monsters, surprisingly most of them do not seem all that opposed to coexisting with monsters. The priests who run the various churches, however, are very much opposed to them, as they are elsewhere. The focus of religion is at the shrine of Ilias to the south and thus the general population in Ilias Village is more likely to hate monsters.]",

The four main regions of Sentora are: the southern Natalia region centered around San Ilia, the western Safina region which surrounds Sabasa, the eastern Noah region dominated by Grand Noah, and the northern Gold region based around Grangold. To the far east is a fifth region centered around Yamatai Village, which is connected to the same landmass but is quite disconnected from the rest of the continent otherwise, and this is generally being considered as part of the Noah region. As Sentora is so huge, the geography and cultures are incredibly varied. Each region contains a main settlement that serves as a hub, and surrounding settlements that can be visited once they are highlighted through dialogue. In this way, each region acts as an equivalent to the smaller continents of Ilias and Hellgondo. Other than human settlements, the continent seems to be a hub for two groups of four legendary beings: the Four Spirits, who can give their power to those seeking it should they prove their worth; and the Guardians of the Directions, who generally rule over their respective regions in some way and guard several of the Six Orbs used to hatch the egg of a Garuda Girl. The degree of faith in Ilias varies from location to location. It is very strict in the south while the north is willing to accept monsters.]\n",

However, they rape those who do trespass on their lands. Though they use the pretext of punishment, in most cases it’s done for their own pleasure and enjoyment, or even for reproduction. Their sexual skills are very potent; the Queen Elf's power is said to rival a succubus's. Normal elves are vegetarians and do not normally eat semen. However, if they do develop a taste for semen, they go through a process called Degeneration, becoming a dark elf. Dark elves are are generally more aggressive, even more sadistic, have an even greater libido, and are rendered incapable of reproduction. Dark elves are known to corrupt men by using their infamous Kiss of Ecstasy skill to drown him in pleasure and then force him to ejaculate. Once a man gives in to their pleasure, he becomes corrupted just like the dark elf, forgetting everything except pleasure. When this happens, the man may single-mindedly have sex with the dark elf to the point where he may die. Elves are seemingly native to the Forest of Spirits, the Safina region until humans drove them out, and Yamatai Village. Many elves have also fled to Enrika, a peaceful village for all races who wish to escape the conflict between humans and monsters.]",

Prior to the present, Lily was born as the daughter of the village lord and a prostitute from Sabasa. She and her mother were bullied by the other villagers due to being outsiders, to the point that when her mother died, they refused to give her a proper burial. Lily’s life did not improve when she was moved to her father’s mansion, as her family also mistreated her. To take revenge, she studied magic from forbidden books and, five years before the present, she used this power to kill her father and brothers. Now the lord of the village, she started the witch hunts to capture villagers as subjects for experiments. At some point (it’s unclear if this was before or after Lily took over as lord), a female villager named Lucia went to the national university in Sabasa to study Magical Science. She later returned to the village and was made another one of Lily’s subjects.]",

She was the first Queen of Sabasa Kingdom and the monster ancestor of the Sabasan Royal Family; including the current generation's Sabasa King and his daughter Sara. The western incarnation of the Guardians of the Directions, she safeguards the Yellow Orb. She is over a thousand years old and due to this she is immune to sealing. A thousand years prior, she fell in love with a man, who she eventually married. The two of them founded the Sabasa Kingdom. However, Sphinx’s husband eventually grew old and sick; yet he refused his wife’s offer of turning into a monster to prolong his life, because he wished to die as a human. Overcome by grief and sorrow, Sphinx was immersed with loneliness; she had considered turning herself into a human as a means of dying along with her husband, but feared that with her death no one would be left to remember him. Since then, she founded the Dragon Seal Trial, a test that, once taken, supports marriage between human and monster (and by law, dragons can only marry humans who have passed the trial).]",

Rumors also speak of hidden elven and kitsune villages, but the secretive monsters keep the location of their settlements hidden to enjoy some measure of tranquility. Contrary to every region south of this one, this area is openly friendly to monsters: humans and monsters work and live side-by-side in Grand Noah, and monsters are openly worshipped in Yamatai Village as the population hopes to attract their favors. Still, it doesn't mean that frictions and conflicts don't happen. Undine's Spring is currently taboo, as the slimes there attack anyone that trespass on their territory, and the Water Spirit is hiding herself.

Unlike the other three kingdoms of Sentora, Grand Noah is a place where humans and monsters coexist. In fact, various monsters make a living by selling their wares in a local market with an Elf owning a Tool Shop, a Minotauros selling her milk, an Alraune selling flowers and a Tarantula Girl trying to pass herself off as a Spider Girl in some form of clothing business. A Slime Girl as well as a Harpy also live in Grand Noah as citizens, while a Dullahan and a Cerberus serve as royal guards. Additionally, a human male owning the Weapon Shop sells armor only for monsters. The main draw of the city is its massive Colosseum that draws in crowds to see fights take place. Originally it was a place for human warriors to battle, however by the time Luka arrives the only serious battles are between monsters, while the human men, unable (or unwilling) to fight back seriously end up getting raped. However, with the fights being a public display there is rarely a case of people being raped to death, though men usually become addicted to the pleasure and return to “fight” over and over again. Another regular face is Kyuba, which is actually a pseudonym for Alma Elma, who comes to fight for fun and to have her fix of men, both of which she loves so much; she also had admitted to hate seeing the Colosseum go away. With the Colosseum mainly drawing men to get their fix of monster sex and the women wanting to watch the men be oppressed by the monsters, the place has become a mere venue for sex shows, much to the dismay of the Grand Noah Queen who wants to restore it to its original honorable use. Every four years, a special event known as the Queen's Cup is held at the Colosseum.]",

Due to this it is quite disconnected from the rest of the world, resulting in its inhabitants having an unusual outlook on life. Being somewhat set apart from the rest of the world, the population of the village don’t seem to know about the Ilias faith. Instead, their religion is more based on the folklore which surrounds the monsters. Certain kinds of monsters are worshipped to the extent that the humans in the village have built shrines for them. These monsters are referred to by their animal basis rather than their species name: kitsune being named \"Mighty Fox\", lamias as \"Mighty Snake\" and Nekomatas as \"Mighty Cat\". The worship is so ingrained that such monsters are always referred to formally and with the utmost respect. Even showing an inch of malice towards any of these monsters is frowned upon and is considered to be folly. Generally the shrines house their respective monsters if they are present. Tamamo of the Four Heavenly Knights also hails from this village, and she likes frequenting the Fox Shrine to bask in the attention and be treated to her beloved fried tofu. Other folklore revolves around monsters such as the Yuki-onna and the dreaded Yamata no Orochi, the latter demanding a sacrifice every year to be delivered in her cave. Towards the end of Luka's stay in the village, Yamata no Orochi is sealed and taken care of in the Snake Shrine to reflect on her actions.]",

The name of Plansect Village itself alludes to such a harmony: \"Plan-\" from Plant and \"-sect\" from Insect. Plansect Village is a place where many plants live in harmony. Once, insects as well lived here, also peacefully. However, due to a recent fierce events have forced the leaders Alra Priestess and Queen Bee to fight against each other, this once-peaceful area has been abruptly shattered into chaos amongst the two factions of plants and insects. Recently, the insects have fled to Red Mountain while the plants have stayed behind. For any travelers, beware, as only the center pond of Plansect Village is safe. Step one foot away from the pond, and you risk being sucked dry by Alra Rooty and Alra Alum. They aren't the only threat though, there's also Alra Prison,Alra Vore, Alra Shroom and Alra Parasol who all travel in packs. Of course, the Canaan Sisters - Dorothy, Raffia and Deana - are also on guard for any trouble being made. Make an enemy out of Alra Priestess, and they will become enemies. Perhaps if someone neither plant nor insect talks sense into both Alra Priestess and Queen Bee, peace between the two species can once again flourish... Unlike the original timeline however, one can act as a peaceful diplomat to mediate between both factions to return both to a peaceful resolution... after dealing with the true instigators that caused the two factions to splinter that is. The Plant Girl and Insect Girl factions have been at war for a long time and are on the brink of a full-fledged civil war, but this can be resolved.]",

This allowed the magic engineers of Grangold to create artificial monsters and to capture and seal the Queen Ant.

In general the Succubi who live outside of Hellgondo live in disguise to avoid persecution from followers of the Goddess Ilias. Notable members are the current queen, Alma Elma, the legendary queens from 500 years ago, Lilith & Lilim, and the Six Ancestor and progenitor of all Succubi, Minagi. While Alma Elma shows absolutely no concern for her species, the succubus race generally have no qualms about not having a leader, due to their desire to be independent. Urban succubi, such as the Succubus Village, also prefer self-government over a mighty queen's reign. Succubi are usually physically defined by demonic horns, tails and bat-like wings, however their biology seems to go a lot further than that. It is shown that Succubi are able to secrete powerful pheromones, radiate seductive auras and morph their body internally, providing a variety of techniques that purely revolve around their internal movements and internal design which can either punish a human or continually drain him in a never-ending ejaculation. It has even been shown that their tails and belly buttons can morph into a variety of orifices to drain men. Interestingly, Succubi seem to only need human semen and spirit energy as a source of food, there has been no example of the monsters breeding directly with humans. However, they do seem to create new generations in a different way, they can use their voluptuous powers to turn human women into fellow Succubi, this is further aided when certain magical powers boost their own. They agree not to kill their \"livestock\" and only drain them until they are severely weak, not that this is seen as a problem for the men.  However, the more powerful succubi generally use these attacks and it is supposed that these are ancient arts of succubus origin, indeed it is shown that the Succubi view sex as not only a means to feed, but an art form in itself, one that they express with much freedom and passion. Goddess Ilias states to detest the succubi the most among all monsters, as they drown in pleasure and make a mockery of life itself. It is also said that Minagi is her most hated monster.]",

Aiming to exterminate all monsters, these humans organize and assault their settlements. Their base of operations is located at Gold Port's church. Originally planning to spread the previous Monster Lord Alice XV (Fifteenth)'s wishes of coexistence between humans and monsters alike after she sacrificed herself to Marcellus' adventuring party, a young Alice XVI (Sixteenth) went berserk after misinterpreting the events upon seeing her mother's deceased body and murdered both Merlin and Karen, the latter of which was a woman whom both Lazarus and Marcellus loved. Out of pure vengeance, they formed the anti-monster terrorist organization and had forsaken Alice XV's ideals. Alice XVI would later regret sparking these chains of events. Sometime after, Marcellus met and married Lucifina and fathered a son, Luka. Eventually realizing that Merlin and Karen would not have wanted revenge, Marcellus went on to betray the organization's ideals and began to aid monsters behind the scenes, hiding them in Enrika. However, Lazarus eventually found out and, believing that his betrayal also meant betraying Merlin and Karen's memory, attacked his best friend out of anger. Having expected Marcellus to easily evade, he had not seen the attack due to an injury from Alice XVI that left him partially blind, and quickly succumbs to the injury. The death of his best friend would drive Lazarus into grief and despair; he would then lie about Marcellus's death being caused by monsters and continue enforcing the organization.]",

It was started by Ilias, and is the root cause for the deterioration of relations between monsters and humans in recent years within the story. Only Ilias and her inner circle knows the true culprit of the massacre, namely the Angels and Chimeras created by Promestein. No one else knows about the true culprit of the massacre in Remina, except for Monster Lord Alice the 16th. Remina was once a city where humans and monsters coexisted peacefully and joyously. It was the only town where humans could live on Hellgondo because the conditions were less harsh than on the remainder of the continent. Humans came to believe that the monsters of Remina had slaughtered its humans, although there were some stories of monster deaths and corpses of both races washed up near Gold Port. In the present day, only chimeras inhabit the area and angel feathers can still be found amongst the ruins, strongly hinting toward its true murderers. In reality Goddess Ilias had her angels and Promestein's chimeras slaughter the entire population because their advancement in science were considered blasphemous by the goddess: they intended to use Heinrich's sword to bring the hero back to life, which, if successful, could have revealed some unsavory information on the twisted and cruel actions of the mostly-yet-incorrectly morally-held Goddess of Light. The slaughter had a major consequence: it reignited the conflict between humans and monsters.]",

Though there are various types of harpies, they generally share the same cheerful behavior and mating desires. Harpies usually live together and have a strong sense of community, often having siblings and even sharing their mate. Currently, the general harpy population resides in Happiness Village under the rule and guidance of their queen, Lucretia. Harpies generally sport brown feathers from the waist down with feathery wing-like ears and some form of downy feathers covering the breasts of younger individuals. It also seems that royal harpies have a much more colorful plumage to communicate their status within the group. Oddly, the harpies of Happiness Village are shown wielding spears and bows, despite the lack of hands (Siren is the only harpy in the game that has hands). In addition to their weaponry, harpies are capable of producing powerful gusts of wind. Seeking to reproduce, they snatch up suitable men and carry them away to their nests to forcibly marry them. A man forced to marry a harpy will be unable to rest, and will spend almost all their time in intercourse with the harpy.\nThis is not a bad fate in itself as harpies also take good care of their chosen husbands, providing highly nutritious food that gives them the stamina and energy to keep up with their new lifestyle. This also enables older husbands to feel and act much younger. Overall, harpies seem content to coexist with humans and as such work with the villagers in Happiness Village, albeit with complications due to extended families. Although they seek to mate with humans and coexist with them, they were previously known to be very war-like. Their previous queen was known to be a ruthless warrior who constantly waged war around the Ilias Continent, and a Cursed Sword user named Desureia was nicknamed the \"Death on Wings\" due to her favoring the Demon Skull Beheading skill.]",

Ilias Village lies to the south, the capital city Iliasburg is located within the center, the Irina Mountains due west, Happiness Village to the east, Enrika within the forests of the southwest, Iliasport to the northwest, and finally the Treasure Cave to the north. The Ilias continent is where faith in the Goddess Ilias is strongest. But although its people have a reputation for prejudice against monsters, surprisingly most of them do not seem all that opposed to coexisting with monsters. The priests who run the various churches, however, are very much opposed to them, as they are elsewhere. The focus of religion is at the shrine of Ilias to the south and thus the general population in Ilias Village is more likely to hate monsters.]",

To the far east is a fifth region centered around Yamatai Village, which is connected to the same landmass but is quite disconnected from the rest of the continent otherwise, and this is generally being considered as part of the Noah region. As Sentora is so huge, the geography and cultures are incredibly varied. Each region contains a main settlement that serves as a hub, and surrounding settlements that can be visited once they are highlighted through dialogue. In this way, each region acts as an equivalent to the smaller continents of Ilias and Hellgondo. Other than human settlements, the continent seems to be a hub for two groups of four legendary beings: the Four Spirits, who can give their power to those seeking it should they prove their worth; and the Guardians of the Directions, who generally rule over their respective regions in some way and guard several of the Six Orbs used to hatch the egg of a Garuda Girl. The degree of faith in Ilias varies from location to location. It is very strict in the south while the north is willing to accept monsters.]\n",

However, they rape those who do trespass on their lands. Though they use the pretext of punishment, in most cases it’s done for their own pleasure and enjoyment, or even for reproduction. Their sexual skills are very potent; the Queen Elf's power is said to rival a succubus's. Normal elves are vegetarians and do not normally eat semen. However, if they do develop a taste for semen, they go through a process called Degeneration, becoming a dark elf. Dark elves are are generally more aggressive, even more sadistic, have an even greater libido, and are rendered incapable of reproduction. Dark elves are known to corrupt men by using their infamous Kiss of Ecstasy skill to drown him in pleasure and then force him to ejaculate. Once a man gives in to their pleasure, he becomes corrupted just like the dark elf, forgetting everything except pleasure. When this happens, the man may single-mindedly have sex with the dark elf to the point where he may die. Elves are seemingly native to the Forest of Spirits, the Safina region until humans drove them out, and Yamatai Village.

Contrary to every region south of this one, this area is openly friendly to monsters: humans and monsters work and live side-by-side in Grand Noah, and monsters are openly worshipped in Yamatai Village as the population hopes to attract their favors. Still, it doesn't mean that frictions and conflicts don't happen.

In fact, various monsters make a living by selling their wares in a local market with an Elf owning a Tool Shop, a Minotauros selling her milk, an Alraune selling flowers and a Tarantula Girl trying to pass herself off as a Spider Girl in some form of clothing business. A Slime Girl as well as a Harpy also live in Grand Noah as citizens, while a Dullahan and a Cerberus serve as royal guards. Additionally, a human male owning the Weapon Shop sells armor only for monsters. The main draw of the city is its massive Colosseum that draws in crowds to see fights take place. Originally it was a place for human warriors to battle, however by the time Luka arrives the only serious battles are between monsters, while the human men, unable (or unwilling) to fight back seriously end up getting raped. However, with the fights being a public display there is rarely a case of people being raped to death, though men usually become addicted to the pleasure and return to “fight” over and over again. Another regular face is Kyuba, which is actually a pseudonym for Alma Elma, who comes to fight for fun and to have her fix of men, both of which she loves so much; she also had admitted to hate seeing the Colosseum go away. With the Colosseum mainly drawing men to get their fix of monster sex and the women wanting to watch the men be oppressed by the monsters, the place has become a mere venue for sex shows, much to the dismay of the Grand Noah Queen who wants to restore it to its original honorable use. Every four years, a special event known as the Queen's Cup is held at the Colosseum.]",

Due to this it is quite disconnected from the rest of the world, resulting in its inhabitants having an unusual outlook on life. Being somewhat set apart from the rest of the world, the population of the village don’t seem to know about the Ilias faith. Instead, their religion is more based on the folklore which surrounds the monsters. Certain kinds of monsters are worshipped to the extent that the humans in the village have built shrines for them. These monsters are referred to by their animal basis rather than their species name: kitsune being named \"Mighty Fox\", lamias as \"Mighty Snake\" and Nekomatas as \"Mighty Cat\". The worship is so ingrained that such monsters are always referred to formally and with the utmost respect. Even showing an inch of malice towards any of these monsters is frowned upon and is considered to be folly. Generally the shrines house their respective monsters if they are present. Tamamo of the Four Heavenly Knights also hails from this village, and she likes frequenting the Fox Shrine to bask in the attention and be treated to her beloved fried tofu. Other folklore revolves around monsters such as the Yuki-onna and the dreaded Yamata no Orochi, the latter demanding a sacrifice every year to be delivered in her cave. Towards the end of Luka's stay in the village, Yamata no Orochi is sealed and taken care of in the Snake Shrine to reflect on her actions.]",

Grangold was once a normal human city. However, Promestein appeared one day in incognito and began providing them with advanced technology. This allowed the magic engineers of Grangold to create artificial monsters and to capture and seal the Queen Ant. By using the Queen Ant's brainwaves to control her Ant Girl daughters, the humans were able to make the Ant Girls serve them as slaves (along with the artificial monsters). The humans no longer bothered to work themselves; even the Grangold King left his duties to the Ant Girls and spent his time listening to adventurers' stories.]",

In general the Succubi who live outside of Hellgondo live in disguise to avoid persecution from followers of the Goddess Ilias. Notable members are the current queen, Alma Elma, the legendary queens from 500 years ago, Lilith & Lilim, and the Six Ancestor and progenitor of all Succubi, Minagi. While Alma Elma shows absolutely no concern for her species, the succubus race generally have no qualms about not having a leader, due to their desire to be independent. Urban succubi, such as the Succubus Village, also prefer self-government over a mighty queen's reign. Succubi are usually physically defined by demonic horns, tails and bat-like wings, however their biology seems to go a lot further than that. It is shown that Succubi are able to secrete powerful pheromones, radiate seductive auras and morph their body internally, providing a variety of techniques that purely revolve around their internal movements and internal design which can either punish a human or continually drain him in a never-ending ejaculation. It has even been shown that their tails and belly buttons can morph into a variety of orifices to drain men. Interestingly, Succubi seem to only need human semen and spirit energy as a source of food, there has been no example of the monsters breeding directly with humans. However, they do seem to create new generations in a different way, they can use their voluptuous powers to turn human women into fellow Succubi, this is further aided when certain magical powers boost their own. They agree not to kill their \"livestock\" and only drain them until they are severely weak, not that this is seen as a problem for the men.  However, the more powerful succubi generally use these attacks and it is supposed that these are ancient arts of succubus origin, indeed it is shown that the Succubi view sex as not only a means to feed, but an art form in itself, one that they express with much freedom and passion. Goddess Ilias states to detest the succubi the most among all monsters, as they drown in pleasure and make a mockery of life itself. It is also said that Minagi is her most hated monster.]",

Originally planning to spread the previous Monster Lord Alice XV (Fifteenth)'s wishes of coexistence between humans and monsters alike after she sacrificed herself to Marcellus' adventuring party, a young Alice XVI (Sixteenth) went berserk after misinterpreting the events upon seeing her mother's deceased body and murdered both Merlin and Karen, the latter of which was a woman whom both Lazarus and Marcellus loved. Out of pure vengeance, they formed the anti-monster terrorist organization and had forsaken Alice XV's ideals. Alice XVI would later regret sparking these chains of events. Sometime after, Marcellus met and married Lucifina and fathered a son, Luka. Eventually realizing that Merlin and Karen would not have wanted revenge, Marcellus went on to betray the organization's ideals and began to aid monsters behind the scenes, hiding them in Enrika. However, Lazarus eventually found out and, believing that his betrayal also meant betraying Merlin and Karen's memory, attacked his best friend out of anger. Having expected Marcellus to easily evade, he had not seen the attack due to an injury from Alice XVI that left him partially blind, and quickly succumbs to the injury. The death of his best friend would drive Lazarus into grief and despair; he would then lie about Marcellus's death being caused by monsters and continue enforcing the organization.]",

It has not been inhabited by humans since the Slaughter of Remina. Its influence has led to monsters generally being stronger in the northern areas of the world, although Remina was also said to have the perfect balance between monsters and humans living together.]",

In reality Goddess Ilias had her angels and Promestein's chimeras slaughter the entire population because their advancement in science were considered blasphemous by the goddess: they intended to use Heinrich's sword to bring the hero back to life, which, if successful, could have revealed some unsavory information on the twisted and cruel actions of the mostly-yet-incorrectly morally-held Goddess of Light.

Though there are various types of harpies, they generally share the same cheerful behavior and mating desires. Harpies usually live together and have a strong sense of community, often having siblings and even sharing their mate. Currently, the general harpy population resides in Happiness Village under the rule and guidance of their queen, Lucretia. Harpies generally sport brown feathers from the waist down with feathery wing-like ears and some form of downy feathers covering the breasts of younger individuals. It also seems that royal harpies have a much more colorful plumage to communicate their status within the group. Oddly, the harpies of Happiness Village are shown wielding spears and bows, despite the lack of hands (Siren is the only harpy in the game that has hands). In addition to their weaponry, harpies are capable of producing powerful gusts of wind. Seeking to reproduce, they snatch up suitable men and carry them away to their nests to forcibly marry them. A man forced to marry a harpy will be unable to rest, and will spend almost all their time in intercourse with the harpy.\nThis is not a bad fate in itself as harpies also take good care of their chosen husbands, providing highly nutritious food that gives them the stamina and energy to keep up with their new lifestyle. This also enables older husbands to feel and act much younger. Overall, harpies seem content to coexist with humans and as such work with the villagers in Happiness Village, albeit with complications due to extended families. Although they seek to mate with humans and coexist with them, they were previously known to be very war-like. Their previous queen was known to be a ruthless warrior who constantly waged war around the Ilias Continent, and a Cursed Sword user named Desureia was nicknamed the \"Death on Wings\" due to her favoring the Demon Skull Beheading skill.]",
