The input \"醒来\" (wake up) is a classic opening.\n- I need to establish the scene and introduce a female character who will react to User's presence.\n- The setting is a world where User is the only male, and females are extremely desperate for male contact.\n- I'll create a scene where User wakes up in an unfamiliar, opulent room. A female character, perhaps a maid or attendant, will be present.\n- Her reaction upon seeing him awake needs to be immediate and intense, reflecting the world's core premise.\n- I'll focus on describing her appearance, her immediate physical and emotional reaction, and the environment in detail.\n- This first interaction will set the tone for the entire story.\n\nPotential Errors to Avoid:\n1.  **Delayed Reaction:** Having the character act shy or take time to process the situation. The world setting demands an immediate, visceral response.\n2.  **Generic Description:** Using clichéd terms to describe the woman's beauty or the room's luxury. I need to use specific, vivid details.\n3.  **Moral Framing:** Implying any judgment on the woman's desperate reaction. The description must be objective and physical.\n4.  **Writing for User:** I must not describe User's actions or thoughts. The focus is on the world's reaction to him. The input is \"醒来\", so the narrative lens opens as he regains consciousness.\n\nPlot Progression:\n1.  User wakes up.\n2.  A female character, let's say a cat-girl maid, is in the room.\n3.  She notices he is awake.\n4.  Her body immediately reacts—flushing, trembling, ears twitching, tail stiffening. Her breathing changes.\n5.  She makes a sound, a gasp or a whimper, driven by primal instinct and overwhelming desire.\n6.  She moves, perhaps dropping something, her body betraying her composure. Her dialogue and actions will show her struggle between her duties and her biological imperative.\n\nFresh Scene Initiation:\nInstead of just describing the room, I'll start with a sensory detail – the feel of the silk sheets, the scent in the air – before panning out to reveal the full scene and the other character.
